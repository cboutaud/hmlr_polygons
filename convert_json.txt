To convert the gml to GeoJSON.

Create a folder called geojsonfiles in your working directory.

Then open terminal and change directory (cd) to your working directory and run the following command.

for f in gmlfiles/*.gml; do newf=`echo | basename $f | sed "s/.gml/.json/"`; ogr2ogr -f "GeoJSON" geojsonfiles/${newf} ${f}; done

If the following error message keeps popping up donâ€™t worry the files will be fine.
